## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently obtaining my bachelor's in CS at UIC and will graduate in 2027. Given the recent boom in AI I am very interested in artifical intelligence and the underlying mathematics of these algorithms. Check out my [Proprietary Feed-Forward Neural Network,](https://github.com/david-love121/Proprietary-Neural-Network) which I built in C# to teach myself about how the general approximation theorem works. I made this project in an object-oriented style which is unconventional for neural networks, but this style allowed me to more easily grasp why this algorithm works and finish the project. I also am a chess player, so I decided to make a [basic chess game](https://github.com/david-love121/Chess2024) in Unity. 

Other than programming, I tutor 4th grade mathematics with Teach for America and have been learning [the community adaptation to 3Blue1Brown's Manim.](https://github.com/manimCommunity/manim) I love mathematics and always try to think about the underlying mathematics of what I'm coding; math allows us to optimize and find mroe reductive versions of what we intend.
