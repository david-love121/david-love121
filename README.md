## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently obtaining my bachelor's in CS at UIC and will graduate in 2027. Given the recent boom in AI I am very interested in artifical intelligence and the underlying mathematics of these algorithms. Check out my [Proprietary Feed-Forward Neural Network,](https://github.com/david-love121/Proprietary-Neural-Network) which I built in C# to teach myself about how the general approximation theorem works. I made this project in an object-oriented style which is unconventional for neural networks, but this style allowed me to more easily grasp why this algorithm works and finish the project. I also am a chess player, so I decided to make a [basic chess game](https://github.com/david-love121/Chess2024) in Unity.

I just finished my new portfolio website. Check out the [live website](https://david-love121.github.io/svelte-developer-portfolio/) or the [repository](https://github.com/david-love121/svelte-developer-portfolio)
